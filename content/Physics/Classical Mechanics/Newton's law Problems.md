The problems are from Chapter 3 of Morin.
- [x] 3.2: Double Atwood's machine: Prequel for the next problem
- [x] 3.3: Infinite Atwood's machine: So far the best problem. It teaches on how to find physically equivalent situations that simplify a problem, and we also have to find $4^N/ \sum_{i=0}^N= 4^i$.
- [x] 3.6: Sliding down the plane: This problem shows the difference between acceleration along the plane (gsin) and horizontal acceleration (gsincos).
- [x] 3.8: Great problem on two sliding blocks. My first mistake was to assume $N = mg\cos(\theta)$, recall why it's wrong. The key idea is to find what sliding with contact means $\rightarrow$ you have to switch frames. 
- [x] 3.9: Just double integration
- [x] 3.11: Falling chain: If a chain remains intact, every part of it must gain the same speed! $\rho yg = \rho l\ddot{y}$
- [x] 3.13: Balancing a pencil: The best problem so far! Solving differential equation (use the fact that it's linear), and using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Amazing final result!
- [x] 3.17: Ball thrown from height h: The result is interesting (symmetrical answer), but it requires too much math grinding (factor when possible!).
- [x] 3.18: Relies on 3.17 Answer. I got stuck because of mismatched convention from 3.17 ... 
An important concept from 3.17 & 3.18 is to imagine the path on object in a reverse case (projectile motion). This can simplify the problem
- [x] 3.19: Longest Path Integral. My main mistake was overseeing a simpler integral. Recall that $L = \int_0^t ||c^{'}(t)||dt$. Other part is just math and ways to integrate $\int \sqrt{1+x^2}dx$
- [x] 3.22: Instructive on Newton in Polar coordinates. Try to write the equations as $mv^2/r, m\dot{v}$.
- [x] 3.24: The easier version of 3.25 (2/4 integrations).
- [x] 3.25: Intuitively, answer is obvious: $\cos(\theta) = r_0/r$ for a linear motion in polar coordinates. You can derive it with Newton's law doing 4 integrations (personally, some of them are *sus* because $dr/dt \cdot 1/r \cdot dt =dr/r$)
