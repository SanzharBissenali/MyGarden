Here we derive Driven Harmonic Oscillator. It's useful to think about the solution of **nonhomogeneous differential equation** with several functions on the right side of the equation. I also used the solution from [[SHM and Damped HM]] to add it to the *particular solution*. 
- Later this should be connected to [[Differential Equations]].
