Honestly, there is not much thing to say here except: "Go and solve some problems", but anyway I'll leave some interesting facts/ideas. 

### Moments to note
- Every piece of rope feels **Tension in both directions** ([[Newton's laws]]). Sometimes it's the same along it (massless rope) and other times it's not.
 - There are two **frictions**: kinetic and **static**. $f_{k} = \mu_{k}N$, while static $f_s \leq \mu_s N$. The way to remember it is just a *thought experiment*. If an object stands on the ground and you slightly push it, then it stays there (lol). But it $f_s = \mu_s N$ (note equality), then it means that standing object slides to the left, when you just barely push it to the right. So, the equality is true at the **limiting case**!
 - If the system is motionless, then **torques** also cancel. There is a good problem on torques (2.11) that requires proof by induction

### Problems to solve 
- [x] 2.1: Hanging rope
- [x] 2.3: Motionless chain - cool problem where you have to use calculus knowledge, like cutting a chain into million small pieces. *My mistake*: wrong length (dl) calculation.
- [x] 2.4: Keeping a book up: default problem on frictions. *My mistake*: to find minimum or maximum take derivatives!
- [x] 2.6: Supporting a disk: still can't solve fully. *My mistake*: massless rope has the same tension!
- [ ] 2.8: Hanging chain (4-star): Need to solve
- [ ] 2.9: Hanging gently: Overthought the problem, much simpler. (Still need to resolve)
- [ ] 2.10: Mountain climber (4-star): Need to solve
- [x] 2.11: Proof related to torques: Cool
- [x] 2.14: Leaning sticks: Simple torque equalities
- [x] 2.16: Balancing the stick: Had a correct idea, but some math went wrong
- [x] 2.17: The **katushka**: correct.
- [x] 2.18: Stick on a circle: correct
- [x] 2.19: Many sticks and circles: Very interesting problem that needs some logic! You also learn how to find the converging sum
