Problems are from Chapter 5 of Morin 
 - [x] 5.1: 120 degrees. Recall how equilibrium is related to the shortest length. 
 - [x] 5.2: To calculate the overall time you can do the integral $\int dx/v$. It seems obvious but I have never had to use it.
 - [ ] 5.3
 - [ ] 5.4
 - [x] 5.7. Bead on a V(x) hill. A good problem that can be solved in two ways. One is much harder (I took that path) with $-g\sin(\theta) = dv/dt$, note that this is not horizontal acceleration $\dot{x}$. The second is quicker and more general.
 - [x] 5.9 Simple Oscillations
 - [ ] 5.15: Accelerating a car with balls
