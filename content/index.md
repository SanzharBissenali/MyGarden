title: Sanzhar's notebook
---
Hey, My name is Sanzhar Bissenali! I enjoy learning, solving interesting (usually hard) problems, and sharing knowledge. Currently, I'm exploring a range of activities, both academic and not. 
Throughout the last year, my interests shifted from organic chemistry to physics and statistics, mainly because of people I've met at [Caltech](https://web.mit.edu).

The site is currently being built, but here are some interesting stuff:
- Physics, my notes from reading Purcell (E&M, [[Electric Potential]]), and Morin's Classical Mechanics ([[Coupled Oscillator & Problems]])
- Statistical learning ([[Bias-Variance Trade-off]]), my notes from [Intro to SL](https://www.statlearning.com)
- Essays or idea dumps (in Russian), where I just talk about my life experiences ([[Zachem Ya Vedu Blog]], [[My Courses Fall term]], [[Nu i kuda ti poidesh s fizikoi?]], ).
