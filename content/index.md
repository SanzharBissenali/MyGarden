LOOOOLLLLL

 
Hey, My name is Sanzhar Bissenali! I enjoy learning, solving interesting (usually hard) problems and sharing knowledge. Currently, I'm exploring range of activities, both academic and not. 
Throughout the last year, my interests shifted from organic chemistry to physics and statistics, mainly because of people I've met at [Caltech](https://web.mit.edu).

The site is currently being built, but here are some interesting stuff:
- Physics, my notes from reading Purcell (E&M, [[Electric Potential]]), and Morin's Classical Mechanics ([[Newton's laws]])
- Statistical learning, my notes from [Intro to SL](https://www.statlearning.com)
- Essays or idea dumps (in russian), where I just talk about my life and experiences.
