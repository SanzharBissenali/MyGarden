 You can think of this as a generalization of a path integrals [[Chapter 7.1 - 7.2 Path and Line Integrals]]. The general definition is given by 
 
 $$
 \int f(\Phi(u,v))\cdot ||\vec{T_u}\times \vec{T_v}||du\;dv)
 $$
 
  Recall that the latter part of the integral is just the Surface Area of $S$ [[Chapter 7.4 - Surface Areas]]. It is easy to derive the formula for when $S$ is $f(x,y)$, and easy to compute it when it is a rectangular $D$ or x/y-simple regions [[Double Integrals over General Regions]]. (1) For $S$ sphere, find $||\vec{T_u}\times \vec{T_v}||$ . (2) When your surface has a constant angle $\theta$ relative to the xy plane, what is a simplification you can/should use. Justify the simplification. 


**Answers:**
1) You should get that $dS = R^2 \sin(\phi)\cdot d\theta \cdot d \phi$ , where $R$ is a constant radius of a sphere. (This was actually derived if the center of the sphere is at $0,0,0$)
2) You can only use this simplification if your surface is a graph!  ![[Pasted image 20240526173020.png]]
