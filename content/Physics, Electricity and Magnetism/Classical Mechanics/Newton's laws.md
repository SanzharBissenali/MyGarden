### 2nd Law
Newton's second law $\textbf{F} = m \textbf{a}$ is not just a Force definition, but it has some real-world implication, as shown in the textbook in contrast to made-up definition. By the way, argue why $\textbf{F} = m \textbf{v}$ can't be true?
### 3rd Law
Interestingly, the third law is equivalent to **conservation of momentum**! If we have particles that interact with each other only:
$$\frac{dp_t}{dt}= \frac{dp_1}{dt} + \frac{dp_2}{dt} = F_1 +F_2$$
