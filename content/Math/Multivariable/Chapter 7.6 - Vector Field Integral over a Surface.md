In an analogy to the Line Integral ([[Chapter 7.1 - 7.2 Path and Line Integrals]]), the surface integral of $\textbf{F}$ has a dot product. Namely, it equals $\int_S \textbf{F} \cdot d\textbf{S}$ , with the parametrization $\Phi$ ([[Chapter 7.3 - Parametrized Surfaces]]), we have that $\int \int_D \vec{F} \cdot (\vec{T_u} \times \vec{T_v})\; du\; dv$. 
(1) Recall what is the parametrization of a unit sphere, and compute the integral with $\vec{F} = \vec{r}$, position vector field.
(2) When the surface is the graph of function $f(x,y)$ what is the $\vec{N}$? 
(3) Similarly, how a line integral can be expressed as a path integral of a scalar function $$
\int _C \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{s} = \int_C\vec{F}\cdot (c^{'}(t))\;dt= \int_C\vec{F} \cdot \frac{(c^{'}(t))}{||(c^{'}(t))||}\cdot ||(c^{'}(t))||\;dt = \int_C f\cdot ||(c^{'}(t))||\;dt
$$
how can you express vector field integral as a scalar field integral?
(4) Derive Gauss's law. 
(5) From q.2 and q.3, you can deduce the formula for the case when surface is $f(x,y)$. It is really similar to the formula in [[Chapter 7.1 - 7.2 Path and Line Integrals]].
