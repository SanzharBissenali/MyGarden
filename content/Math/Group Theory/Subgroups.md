>[!note] Definition
> A subset $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ when it is closed under addition and has an inverse for every element: $\forall x \in H\; \exists x^{-1} \text{such that}\; xx^{-1} = 1$

So, all we need to check is the closure under multiplication and existence of inverses for all elements. Actually, for finite sets you only have to check the first assertion. Sketch the proof (1).

One of the ways to generate a subgroup is to pick an element $x$, and collect all of its orders $x, x^1, x^{-1}, x^2, x^{-2} ... x^n$. This guarantees the two requirements. We then define such groups **Cyclic**, $H = \langle x\rangle$
