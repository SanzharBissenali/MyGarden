The problems are from Chapter 3 of Morin.

- [x] 3.2: Double Atwood's machine: Prequel for the next problem
- [x] 3.3: Infinite Atwood's machine: So far the best problem. It teaches on how to find physically equivalent situations that simplify a problem, and we also have to find $4^N/ \sum_{i=0}^N= 4^i$.
- [x] 3.6: Sliding down the plane: This problem shows the difference between acceleration along the plane (gsin) and horizontal acceleration (gsincos).
- [x] 3.8: Great problem on two sliding blocks. My first mistake was to assume $N = mg\cos(\theta)$, recall why it's wrong. The key idea is to find what sliding with contact means $\rightarrow$ you have to switch frames. 
- [x] 3.9: Just double intergration
- [x] 3.11: Falling chain: If a chain remains intact, every part of it must gain the same speed! $\rho yg = \rho l\ddot{y}$ !
